'''Create a program that takes the length of the password as input and generates a random password of the same length. The strength of the password depends equally on the 4 properties mentioned below. If the password generated randomly following the rules or constraints given below, then that password is treated as good in terms of strength and accepted otherwise ignore that password.'''
